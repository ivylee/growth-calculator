For a business, Profit = Revenue - Expense.

For Revenue and Expense, we assume an exponential growth model with constant growth rate.

R_t = R_0(r_R + 1)^t

E_t = E_0(r_E + 1)^t

where

R_t - Revenue at time t

R_0 - Revenue at time 0

r_R - Revenue growth rate per time period

E_t - Expense at time t

E_0 - Expense at time 0

r_E - Expense growth rate per time period
